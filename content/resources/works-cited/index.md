Mann, Adam. “Search for Alien Life Should Be a Fundamental Part of NASA, New Report Urges.” 
Scientific American, 15 Oct. 2018, https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/search-for-alien-life-should-be-a-fundamental-part-of-nasa-new-report-urges/.

Summary:

    The source's primary argument is that NASA should take on a higher role in the field of astrobiology. Not only pushing usage of radio technology to try to communicate with outside civilizations but to expand instrumentation for looking for and observing even the smallest of life on other planets. The author of the article published the piece after seeing the report published from the National Academy of Sciences declaring that astrobiology should be an essential part of future missions. 
Evaluation:

    The author Adam Mann is a journalist who’s pieces I’ve read across the many platforms he’s been published on like National Geographic and the Wall Street Journal. Specializing in astronomy and physics he’s published many articles about telescope arrays and the happenings of space agencies with some topics like the above touching on our search for life outside our biosphere. I like how this piece didn’t cover using radio signals to look for life like the SETI allen telescope array does but focused instead on the astrobiology pieces that are crucial if not critical to future missions.

Wright, Jason. “NASA Should Start Funding SETI Again.”
 Scientific American, 7 Feb. 2018, https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/nasa-should-start-funding-seti-again/.

Summary:
    The author's primary argument is that NASA should be able to invest parts of it’s funding into SETI again. That politicians are ready to hear the argument that the search for extraterrestrial life is an essential part of nasa's future missions. The author covers the history of Richard Bryans decision in 1993 to stop NASA from investing in SETI and it’s problems. The authors covers the three main topics that seem to keep SETI from being under NASAs portfolio, that it’s just a search for little green men, it’s unlikely it’ll produce anything and that it’ll secure funding elsewhere. All of these things are false.

Evaluation:
    The author James Wright is an Associate Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics at Pennsylvania State University and writes as if he’s having an argument about his own thoughts which creates a well structured paper covering both sides of a topic. The author's understanding of the history on the topic and ideas on what we can do to help ourselves succeed in the future shed light on the topic in ways that I didn’t know previously. James not only talks about astrobiology being important to future missions but the understanding that radio instrumentation is just as important in our research.

“User Clip: Sen. Bryan and Seti” 
C-SPAN, 14 Sep. 1993, 
https://www.c-span.org/video/?c3963846/user-clip-sen-bryan-seti

Summary:
    The author quotes Richard Bryas a democratic politician in 1993 who killed SETI funding from NASA. The author states the current status of SETI and makes light of how small a program it is.
Evaluation:
    The only direct quote of the politician I could find. Even without an author of the article it shows how disconnected this senator was. A few words is all it took to kill what is an important piece of the scientific community and people simply forgot about it because the program if it doesn’t find anything seems to almost not exist. It was a cheap shot and easy target to hit seti.

Business Insider, 30 Sept. 2016, https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-search-intelligent-alien-life-seti-funding-2016-9.

Summary:
The source's primary argument is that SETI should still be part of the NASA budget, that it’s hard to manage a large organization that works at the cutting edge of science with people's $10 and $20 dollar donations. The politicians who pushed SETI out of nasas budget were out of touch and that while the scientific community agrees that SETI radio is just as much a part of nasa as astrobiology is, it's too hard to get this program back into the budget.
Evaluation:
    Seth Shostak the astronomer guest in the video has been a part of the seti project since it was still funded by NASA,  he’s a good resource when it comes to the inner workings of the organization past and present. His thoughts on the topic are not very extreme in terms of demands, he almost asks for pittance with the idea that nasa already looks for signs of biological life so radio searching for intelligent life shouldn't be that much more of an addition. They took 1/1000th the budget and helped push radio instrumentation. There’s 0 chance of finding life unless they don't look which is why I love this piece.

Garber, Stephen. 
“Searching for Good Science: The Cancellation of NASA's SETI Program.” 
The British Interplanetery Society, vol. 52, 1999, pp. 3–12.

Summary:
    This article is a historical document written by Stepehen Garber covering the math and reasons behind SETIs removal from the NASA budget. While rather dry this looks at the equations used and numbers to determine why thai needs to be removed. The document also has references to many private conversations that took place around this topic when deciding on the budget. It’s easy to find articles on why SETI should be reintroduced. This really covers why it shouldn’t.

Evaluation:
Stephen Garber is a policy analyst at Nasa with a masters in Science and Tech from Virginia Tech and focuses on national security in space. His piece is great at explaining the why behind people thinking seti was a worthwhile program to believe. These points are mostly reiterated in my first source but there were many other vocal people calling for the removal of the search for intelligent life from nasas budget and this loops a number of them in. Listing shortcomings and pitfalls of the program this really hones in on the point that people truly just mock the idea of finding aliens and kick the program while it was already down. I really hope the reader finds this not to be enough of an argument to warrant it’s removal.

director. Astronomer Explains How SETI Searches for Aliens. WIRED,

Summary:
    Jill argues that we haven't seen enough of the universe to wash out the idea that SETI could do something worthwhile. We’ve only seen a bathtub compared to all of earth's oceans of the universe and we need more funding to explore. The argument is also made that humanity just isn’t ready yet, there’s a chance that we’re just not far enough as a civilization to join our intergalactic community. Jill points to the fact that we are still finding life deep within oceans and in what we thought were uninhabitable places which points to the fact that life can really pop up anywhere and isn't really special.
Evaluation:
    Jill is a SETI institute director and has been a part of the program for many years, I really like how she answers questions from a scientific standpoint often tossing out the notion of belief and focusing on what we know. Jill touches on the sudo science people tend to believe about seeing UFOs and explains some of the things we see in the night sky. Her expertise and thoughts are profound, I would love to get the chance to talk to her but really this goes to show that we have some incredible people who do amazing work and it really makes me believe that if funded we could find alien life in the 21st century like she says.
