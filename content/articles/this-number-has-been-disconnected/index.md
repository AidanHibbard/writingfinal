The victims of the new isolationism are everywhere. In the latest attempt to trim Government, funds for NASA's Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) have been cut from the 1994 budget. SETI is an easy target, of course, since it has a small constituency: a few scientists, some space buffs and an unknown number of extremely undocumented aliens.

The idea is that intelligent life might well produce radio waves and eavesdropping is cheap. Over the past 20 years, Federal expenditures have been $58 million.

Senator Richard Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, a foe of SETI and a sucker for an easy gag, pointed out in a press release that since listening started in October 1992 "not a single Martian has said, 'Take me to your leader,' and not a single flying saucer has applied for F.A.A approval." As a result of Senator Bryan comments, Mars canceled its own Search for Terrestrial Intelligence (STI).

The SETI Institute, a private nonprofit group, is attempting to raise money to continue the search. It is seeking extragovernmental sources of funds, but it is not, so far, broadcasting an appeal over the radio waves.
